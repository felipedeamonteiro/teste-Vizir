## Instructions

Before run the project, make sure you have node installed and npm. After that, download the project. I prefer using yarn to run the project, but it's possible to use npm.

After the download, in the terminal open the folder of the project and run ``` yarn create react-app my-react-app```. After that, run ```yarn start```. After this the project will open in ```http://localhost:3000```.
